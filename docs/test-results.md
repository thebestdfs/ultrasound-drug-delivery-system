# Test Results

## Summary
Initial testing showed a drug release efficiency of 65% under optimal ultrasound settings.

## Data
| Test | Frequency (kHz) | Release Rate (%) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | 800 | 60 |
| 2 | 1000 | 65 |
| 3 | 1200 | 62 |

## Observations
- Higher frequencies increased release rates but risked tissue damage.
